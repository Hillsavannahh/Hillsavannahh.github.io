        <p class= "infoBlocks">I wanna say I've always been very good at school, atleast up to the expectations of my schools. I have always lived in the same counties but I have gone to 3 very different schools. Elementary school was preschool through 8th grade, I had gone to a different preschool though(so techinically 5 schools if you also count daycare). My freshman year of highschool was seperate from my actual highschool. These werent those types of schools seperated but still in the same property , this school was basically across town. To be honest leaving middle school was a very hard transition for me, going into my freshman year I was gonna be with atleast 200 new people ive never met before. This was 4+ schools all meeting at this tiny school with the oldest teachers in the world.  </p>
