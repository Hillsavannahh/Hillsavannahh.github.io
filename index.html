      <p class="headings">My Experience</p>
      <p class="infoBlocks">As a junior in highschool I can definitely understand the struggle of not being able to save your money even though we believe that since we were teenagers it doesn't matter. I started working when I was 12 and did many small hobbies like babysitting, cleaning my family's yards for money, etc. While being younger I didn't care where my money went, if I had seen something I liked I would've automatically bought it. I realized once I was actually old enough to get a real job that saving my money is very productive. My problem was that I believed since I was young there was no problem.</p>

      <p class="headings">First Tip</p>
      <p class="infoBlocks">One effective way of saving your money is to go to the ATM and take out half of what you got paid whether it's only 200 or 100. Use the other money you got paid to do whatever you want with it. I personally take my money out in cash and keep it in a secured spot. This way can be hard because if you run out of your spending money it's typically really easy to convince yourself to just go grab a $20 and you'll be okay. You have to stay motivated in order to successfully reach your goal of saving money.
      </p>
      <p class="infoBlocks">This is the main way I tend to save my own money based on the fact that I dont help with any bills or payments as of right now, my guardians deal with all of that, atleast until I become 18. This saving method is something I would only do when im younger just because of me not having to pay for anything bill wise.   </p>

    <div id="col-4">
      <p class="headings">40/40/20 or 50/30/20</p>
      <p class="infoBlocks">This method is more for adults with jobs from college 
        degrees and one of the easiest ways to keep your money seperated, 40% to taxes, 
        save the other 40%, and use the 20% for your wants. Same way with 50/30/20, 50% to taxes,
        30% to savings, and 20% again for your wants. I know a lot of people who use this method 
        every paycheck and yes it may be a good idea I think it may be too organized for me. However
         coming from a teenager i dont think this is necessarily something you would need to do now,
          it may be a good way to seperate your money but not typically just saving. </p>

    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I've grown up in a very small town with a family who supported me in everyway possible no matter 
      the cost. Unforuently for me, when i started making my own money i just constantly wanted to spend 
      that money rather then save it up for my future. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly realizing my typical mistake i took on the saving method where you save half of your check and put it away, 
      since then ive saved up somewhere between 5-10k in just less than a year. As a 17 year old i think that saving your money is extremely important.
